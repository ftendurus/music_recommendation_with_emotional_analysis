# Music Recommendation with Emotional Analysis

This project aims to provide music recommendations to listeners using emotional analysis. It utilizes artificial intelligence models to analyze the emotional content of music tracks and recommend music that matches the emotional state of the users.

## How it Works?
Data Collection and Preprocessing:
Data sets are collected from various music platforms and open-source repositories.
The collected data is processed and cleaned with emotional tags.

## Emotional Analysis:
Music tracks are processed using emotional analysis algorithms.
Emotional profiling is created for each music track.

## Recommendation System:
User emotional states are determined through the analysis of various features (tempo, melody, lyrics, etc.).
Music matching the user's emotional state is recommended by selecting from other music tracks with similar emotional profiles.
